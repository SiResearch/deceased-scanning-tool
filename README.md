# Deceased Person Search Tool

By [@SiWiFi](https://t.me/SiWiFi)

I have not documented this much yet due to lack of time, sorry. May get to it if there's enough interest.

Built using Vue JS and the vue-cli tool. Runs in-browser.


## To setup a local copy

Clone this repository to your local computer and then run:

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Run this command when developing:

```
npm run serve
```

And then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Compiles and minifies for production

To deploy changes, run:

```
npm run build
```

And then commit ALL the updated files. All the files from the /docs/ directory will then be automatically deployed by Github to https://siresearch.github.io/deceased-scanning-tool/


### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
