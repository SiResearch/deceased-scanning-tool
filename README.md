# Deceased Person Search Tool

By [@SiWiFi](https://t.me/SiWiFi)

I have not documented this much yet due to lack of time, sorry. May get to it if there's enough interest.

Built using Vue JS and the vue-cli tool. Runs in-browser.


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```


### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
